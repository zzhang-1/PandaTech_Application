Part 1 : what you already know:

  """
   general idea, we just need to conside to shift the arr once for all, we just need to make sure the last element is smaller than frist   
   element then it is possible to get sorted array by right shift. 
   for example: [3,4,5,1,2] in this array, where the part is not in order is 5, and 1, the rest are in order, so we take the first 
   of array and put in the end  [1,2] + [3,4,5] we only need to see if 2 is smaller than 3, if not then there is no way to sort the array 
   by right shift 
   another example like [1, 4, 3 ,5] => [3, 5] + [1,4] => since 5 is greater than 1, there is no way to sorted array by right shift
